"""
Variables are containers for storing values.
We can store any data values in python variable
In python no need to declare any command to create a variable.
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

Python variables Rules
=========================
A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character (a = 5 or _name= "python" or name = "python" )
A variable name cannot start with a number (a_a = 5 or 1name ="python" )
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _) (name_1 = "python)
Variable names are case-sensitive (name, Name and NAME are three different variables)
